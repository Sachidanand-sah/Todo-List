# Responsive Todo List Application

## Project Description

A feature-rich, responsive Todo List application built using React and Firebase. This project demonstrates essential React skills such as component-based architecture, state management, event handling, and styling. It also incorporates cloud storage with Firebase Firestore for persistent data storage.

## Features

1. **Add Todos**: Users can input and add tasks to the list. The input field clears after submission.
2. **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed with a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinct (strikethrough text and grayed out).
3. **Delete Todos**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
4. **Filter Tasks**: Filter options to display All, Active, or Completed tasks.
5. **Add Project Details**: Users can associate tasks with projects and specify start and end dates for each task.
6. **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in Firebase Firestore, ensuring they persist across page reloads.
7. **Responsive UI**: Built using React-Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap**: For responsive and attractive UI components.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Cloud NoSQL database for storing tasks.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Language used for logic and functionality.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Firebase account (with Firestore enabled)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sachidanand-sah/Todo-List.git
   cd responsive-todo-list
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firestore Database.
   - Copy your Firebase configuration from the Firebase Console.
   - Create a new file `firebase/firebaseConfig.js` in the project and add the configuration:
     ```javascript
     import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
     import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

     const firebaseConfig = {
         apiKey: "AIzaSyDYfAUHCsJhGoAu1OcbxvyxUpjb6rZQ79M",
         authDomain: "todo-application-bba81.firebaseapp.com",
         databaseURL: "https://todo-application-bba81-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
         projectId: "todo-application-bba81",
         storageBucket: "todo-application-bba81.firebasestorage.app",
         messagingSenderId: "942024253790",
         appId: "1:942024253790:web:6ee75e69ed5b15c180efcf"
       };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
     const db = getFirestore(app);

     export default db;

     ```

4. **Run the Project**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

### Deployment (Optional)

- **Deploy on Firebase Hosting**:
  1. Install Firebase CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g firebase-tools
     ```
  2. Log in to Firebase:
     ```bash
     firebase login
     ```
  3. Initialize Firebase:
     ```bash
     firebase init
     ```
  4. Build the project:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
  5. Deploy:
     ```bash
     firebase deploy
     ```
